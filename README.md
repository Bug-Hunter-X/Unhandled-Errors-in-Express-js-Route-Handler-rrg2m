This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a vulnerable route that lacks error handling for request body parsing failures and database interaction errors. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, crashes, and security vulnerabilities. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.
